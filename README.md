# Big-Data-2019
This repository features the code and documentation used in the design and development of my Big Data CA from 2019. This project focussed on the prediction of movie ratings.

The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) has been a go to source for everything movie related. It features the information of thousands upon thousands of movies and allows users the chance to rate these movies based on their own feedback and through a scoring system. IMDb uses a scoring system of 0.0 to 10.0. This project is designed to predict the IMDb score using machine learning algorithms.
